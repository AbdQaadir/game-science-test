# Game Science Assessment - Roll Dice

This project is an assessment for the Frontend Developer Role at Game Science. And it's being built with React. I make use of the [Rolz API](https://rolz.org/help/api) to get the dice data and then show a graphical representation of the dice in the app's UI.

## Available Scripts

To run the project locally, run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

I also implemented testing with Jest and Enzyme. To test the project, run `yarn test`.\ This will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
